### üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Place your own background image as `background.jpg` in the same directory
3. Open `index.html` in your browser or use amplify to host on AWS.

> **Note**: You must have internet access to load AWS + USDA APIs from CDN.

### üîê API Keys Required

1. **USDA API Key**
   Sign up at [https://api.data.gov/signup](https://api.data.gov/signup) and get a free API key.
   Replace the placeholder in `index.html`:

   ```js
   const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';
   ```

2. **AWS Cognito Identity Pool ID**
   Used for anonymous Rekognition access.
   Replace this with your own identity pool:

   ```js
   IdentityPoolId: 'Replace with your pool ID'
   ```

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

* Calorie values are typically per 100g (as provided by USDA).
* Rekognition may return non-food labels
* No server backend ‚Äî everything runs client-side (keys are visible in browser).
* USDA database may not return exact matches for all labels.

---

### üìà Future Improvements

* Filter non-food labels automatically
* Add portion-size selector (e.g., 1 apple, 1 slice, etc.)
* Use a backend to hide API keys and cache frequent foods
* Add nutrition breakdown (protein, carbs, fats)
